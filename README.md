# CHANTS – **RNA-seq Analysis of HCO₃ treatment (0 vs 30 min)**

**Salmonella Typhimurium Human Challenge Study (CHANTS): RNA-seq dataset and interactive analysis**  
- **D23580 (ST313)**  
- **4/74 (ST19)**  

This repository provides interactive volcano plots for **within-strain differential expression**, comparing **HCO₃ treatment at 0 minutes vs 30 minutes**.  
It represents a focused RNA-seq dataset from the broader CHANTS study.

## Interactive Plots

- [Volcano Plot: D23580 (ST313)](https://adalijuanluo.github.io/CHANTS_RNAseq/D23_Interactive_volcano_plot.html)  
- [Volcano Plot: 4/74 (ST19)](https://adalijuanluo.github.io/CHANTS_RNAseq/474_Interactive_volcano_plot.html)  

Hover over each point to see the corresponding **gene label**. Genes are color-coded to represent up- and down-regulation.

## Data Availability

- **Raw RNA-seq data**: deposited in GEO under accession **GSEXXXXXX** (to be updated).  
- **Interactive visualizations & code**: available in this GitHub repository.  
- **Permanent archival copy**: (optional, Zenodo DOI once minted).
