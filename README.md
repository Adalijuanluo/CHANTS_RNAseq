# Salmonella Typhimurium Human Challenge Study (CHANTS)

**RNA-seq comparison of two Salmonella Typhimurium strains:**  
- **D23580 (ST313)**  
- **4/74 (ST19)**  

This repository contains interactive visualizations of RNA-seq data from the CHANTS study. The volcano plots highlight differentially expressed genes following **HCO₃⁻ treatment (0 minutes vs 30 minutes)** for each strain.

## Interactive Plots

- [Volcano Plot: D23580 (ST313)](https://adalijuanluo.github.io/CHANTS_RNAseq/D23_Interactive_volcano_plot.html)  
- [Volcano Plot: 4/74 (ST19)](https://adalijuanluo.github.io/CHANTS_RNAseq/474_Interactive_volcano_plot.html)  

Hover over each point to see the corresponding **gene label**. Genes are color-coded to represent up- and down-regulation.

## Data Availability

- **Raw RNA-seq data**: deposited in GEO under accession **GSEXXXXXX** (to be updated).  
- **Interactive visualizations & code**: available in this GitHub repository.  
- **Permanent archival copy**: (optional, Zenodo DOI once minted).
